        In an effort to continually learn new technologies and stay abreast of existing technologies, I have found it helpful to take advantage of opportunities for continuing education. Below I have listed the classes both classroom and online that I have attended over the years.
        Here is a list of the certifications that I have attained over the past few years.
        <ul>

        <h3>Penetration Testing with Kali Linux</h3>
        <p>I took this class in preparation for their certification exam (OSCP). Unfortunately, I did not pass the exam attempt. However, the class time alone was extremely informative so I thought I would put this experience here.</p>
