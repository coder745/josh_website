            <h3>Note / URL System (2017)</h3>
            <h4>PHP/Laravel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
            <p>This application will be written to house all of my many tech notes and URL book marks. I know there are many applications out there written for both tasks. However, I have tried many of these and I do not like their features. This application will be written using the latest version of Laravel.</p>
            <p>Essentially, it will allow my to add notes and tag them to URLs. It will also include features for stand alone notes and URLs as well as note searching and tagging. This application is currently a work in progress. I will be posting the code on GitHub and keeping this entry update as I make progress.</p>

            <h3>This Website (joshyoung.me - 2016)</h3>
            <h4>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Jekyll</h4>
            <p>I wrote this site to house my personal blog, projects, resume, etc. I decided to write this with a static site generator. Following my research, I decided that Jekyll was the best option for my purposes. This site is written in Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. Here is the link to the site: <a href='http://www.joshyoung.me'>joshyoung.me</a>. Here is a link to the GitHub pages entry: <a href=''>GitHub Pages Entry</a>.</p>

            <h3>Note Taking System (2012)</h3>
            <h4>(Python, Flask, SQLite)</h4>
            <p>This project was written in the Python Flask framework. Essentually, it is a note taking system that allows for note taking features such as tagging, searching, etc. To learn more about SQLite, I decided to build this in SQLite. This project was a precursor to my Laravel note taking system listed above.</p>

            <h3>Ticketing System: (2010)</h3>
            <h4>C#, MSSQL, ASP.NET, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
            <p>This project was exactly idential to the project listed below. However, I decided to re-write it in C#/ASP.NET. By doing this, I was able to better learn the Microsoft development stack. I was also able to interact with the Microsoft SQL Server, which has come in handy in my subsequent development tasks.</p>

            <h3>Ticketing System (2010)</h3>
            <h4>PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
            This project was essentually a help desk sytem that I wrote from scratch using PHP. It allowed for many features including: entry, tagging, searching, editing, and deleting. Of course it also involved creating correct database structure including normalization between each of the tables. At the time, this was a great learning experience for me and improved my skills as a developer.</p>

            <h3>Business Website (codeitcreations.com - 2010)</h3>
            <h4>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP</h4>
            <p>This was a site I wrote around 2010 around the time I was doing some freelancing. This was a one page site written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. For a while, I had this site hosted and running on a web server; however, I have since moved it to GitHub pages. The site is still running here: <a href='http://www.codeitcreations.com'>codeitcreations.com</a>.</p>
            <p>This site displays many of the designs I had finished or sites that I had worked on at the time. So you may find them interesting for that purpose. I also designed codeitcreations.com myself as well. Although, I will not claim to have great design skills. They haved definitely gotten better over the years. However, I have never claimed to be a great designer, as development is that I enjoy.</p>

            <h3>Personal Website (joshayoung.com - 2010)</h3>
            <h4>HTML, JavaScript, CSS, jQuery</h4>
            <p>This was a site I built backin 2010. Essentually, this site was a precursor to this web page. However, at the time I had not gotten into responsive webdesign. Therefore much of the site is not optimized for fast load times, responsiveness and the like. This site was written in raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. I also designed the site myself. I have learned a ton about web development since that time, but I list the site here for archival purposes. I have made very few changes since it was written in 2010. I have the site running on GitHub here: <a href='http://www.joshayoung.com'>joshayoung.com</a>.</p>

            <h3>Family Website (commentsandcapers.com - 2009)</h3>
            <h4>HTML, WordPress, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
            <p>I built this website using WordPress. It was built to allow my grandmother to maintain her own website. I started by creating a custom theme that was based on the website layout. In addition, I also has an alternative theme designed to look exactly like she wanted running on a select page.</p>
            <p>I designed the site myself and also wrote soem custom PHP code. The custom PHP code allowd for guest commenting and contact withing the site. I maintained the site for years inside of WordPress. Unforunately, my grandmother recently died. I have since moved the whole site to GitHub pages for archival purposes. I still have the site running here: <a href='http://www.commentsandcapers.com'>commentsandcapers.com</a>. Aside from a few small changes, I have made no changes to the code since it was written in 2009. So keep in mind I have learned a lot and improved my development skills since then.</p>

            <h3>Blogging System (Summer 2008)</h3>
            <h4>PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
            <p>This was a project that built during the summer in 2008. I built my own server from parts. Following that I setup my own web server running Apache. This project was built in raw PHP code.</p>
            <p>It allowed users to post, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as comment on the individual posts. All of the HTML and CSS was also written from scratch. I designed the project myself. This was a great learning experience and school project for me to learn more about the fundamentals of programming, servers, and web development in general.</p>
