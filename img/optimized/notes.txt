The SVG images in this folder were optimized with the node 'svgo' command below:
svgo --pretty [filename] [optimized filename]

example: svgo --pretty img/git.svg img/optimized/git_optimized.svg

I moved them into this folder and then took the code from these files and implemented it into the html page.
