After using Atom for a few months, I decided to give Visual Studio Code a try. After a few weeks of use, it really seems more polished than Atom. Although I like many of the features of Atom and still use it occasonally for specific tasks, I find VSCode more enjoyable to use. The visual interface is more professional and they plugin integration is superbe. The best part is that I now have an excellent editor that works on both my Mac and Linux machines and supports Vim well.
