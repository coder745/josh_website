I recently made the switch to Atom from Sublime Text 2. My first thoughts are that the vim support is much better. Over the years I have bounced around between a few different development environments, but Atom is by far the best so far.

I have found the following plugins useful:

* vim-mode
* ex-mode
* color-picker
* relative-numbers
* git-plug
* git-time-machine
* todo-show
