Before now, I have not really had must need for GIT because most of my projects were developed and maintained only by me. However, after some consideration, I decided that it would be benefitial to be able to launch new designs and maintenance projects within GIT branches. I also wanted to find a GUI git manager for my projects. It seems that GitKracken has a great interface and works on Window, Mac, and Linux.
