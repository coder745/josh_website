I have always loved JavaScript. In fact, it is probably my favorite language. On the surface it seems simple. Indeed, the basic syntax is easy for anyone to pick-up. However, upon investistigation it is a very complex and powerful language. For a while now, I have been trying out a few of the different JavaScript platforms. They all have there pluses and minuses, but it seems that React gives you the most flexibility to use other systems for the backend. After all, React is just a view. I have started taking Wes Bos's course on React and found it very helpful. I plan to integrate React into some of my existing and new projects at work.
