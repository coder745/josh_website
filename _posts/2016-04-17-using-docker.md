Currently I am doing docker research to see how I can build that into my development workflow. From what I have been able to tell, docker is replacing a lot of the need for applications like Vagrant. With Docker, I can setup isolated containers for specific versions of my development environments. This way my host machine does not need to be cluttered with different versions if software.
